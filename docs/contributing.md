# Contributing

RLN is pre-release and moves quickly. Contributions are welcome.

## What to contribute

- Documentation improvements (clarity, examples, diagrams).
- Bug reports with reproduction steps (include network, chain source URL, and `GET /api/v1/version` output).
- Code contributions (small, focused PRs).

## Documentation discipline

If you change API/CLI behavior, update the corresponding docs:

- [HTTP API reference](./api/http-api.md)
- CLI help and examples (e.g. `crates/cli/README.md`, `docs/cli/*`)
- tutorial pages that mention the changed behavior
